# credexchange
One time sharing of credentials

## Description

I'm creating this project because I'm tired of using a variety of unreliable and complex processes for the transfer of credentials from one person to another.

## How does it work

By using a password provided at encyrpt time to locally encrypt the password we can ensure that the value that ends up in our the database is not reversable or decryptable by anyone other than the creator.

Once the encrypted password has been downloaded it is deleted from the database.
